# Client_Server_Project2
Using Python code to develop Jupyter dashboard and link MongoDB to data frame. Uses imported python header file for CRUD operations.


How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

  Organization and separation of code files creates manageable and adaptable programs while well-commented code helps with readability. The CRUD python file is easily implemented across different Jupyter Dashboard applications and could be used in the future simply by importing it as a header file to connect with MongoDB.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

  I believe that when approaching problems as a computer scientist it is important to first understand the question or the requirements for the project. I believe the approach for this project started out by setting up the main database in MongoDB, then following with general CRUD operations that could easily be reused for other projects. Finally the more specific work was done to implement a dashboard that completed the requirements for the project.
  The main technique that I would use in the future is to reuse this same approach in order to create databases and dashboards that met the requests of clients in an efficient manner with code that has already been used and tested.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

  Computer scientists use their knowledge of code to communicate accross different data systems in order to provide specific and detailed answers that can be tedious or hard to find otherwise. The work is generally easily reused, easily built-upon, and can then be used to find solutions to more problems or questions. This is why this type of project would be able to help a company like Grazioso Salvare to do their work more efficiently without sifting through major datasets in order to find the information for which they are looking.
